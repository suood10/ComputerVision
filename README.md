This document provides a comprehensive overview of the work conducted by the Perception Committee within the Fly Eagle team, in collaboration with Khalifa University, for their participation in MBZIRC. The primary goal of their project is to create a sophisticated algorithm designed for Unmanned Sailing Vehicles (USVs). This algorithm serves the crucial purpose of identifying and targeting vessels suspected of transporting illicit shipments. Once identified, the USV autonomously approaches the suspicious vessel, and upon confirmation, seizes the illegal shipment, thereby contributing significantly to maritime security efforts.
